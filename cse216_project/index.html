<p><span class="ss">EQUIPMENT:</span> T-pins. Scissors. Tape
measure or ruler. Knotting board
(brown paper marked off in one inch
squares for gauge. Place over
knotting board of Celotex, cork, or
padded cardboard). Rubber bands for
bobbins (wind lengths overhand,
secure with rubber band and release
as needed). 1-yarn needle.</p>
<p><span class="ss">KNOTTING:</span> 1. Keep the foundation
yarn secure and in place by using
T-pins in the overhand knot at either
end. 2. Keep leader taut and straight
on an angle or parallel to the
foundation yarn. 3. Tie knots tightly
to cover leader. 4. Secure with pins to
keep accurate measurement. (Use the
one inch squares as a gauge.)</p>
<p>Learn all knots on sample piece before
beginning, making sure to acquire the
right tension. This will enable you to
identify the knots.</p>
<p>Five knots are used in this booklet.
They are basically the same differing
mainly in direction. 1. Reversed
Double Half Hitch (R D H H) as shown
in <a href="#fig1" class="pginternal">figure #1</a>, used for mounting
lengths onto foundation yarn. Fold
length in half, tuck looped end over
foundation yarn and pull toward you,
tuck loose ends into loop and tighten.
2. Overhand Knot (O H K) as shown in
<a href="#fig2" class="pginternal">figure #2</a>. Hold length in left hand,
with right hand bring it up and over
towards the left through loop formed,
tighten. 3. Vertical Half Hitch (V H H)
as shown in <a href="#fig3" class="pginternal">figure #3</a>. Hold one
length in left hand, with right hand
bring next length around and between
the two lengths (counts as one knot).
Bring left length around right and
between the two lengths. Continue for
the number of knots indicated. 4.
Diagonal Double Half Hitch (D D H H)
as shown in <a href="#fig4" class="pginternal">figure #4</a>. Working from
left to right, the leader (length on
which the knots are tied) is held in the
right hand. Each length is knotted onto
it in the same manner as the first knot
of the V H H two times. The leader is
held taut and on a downward angle.
Working from right to left the leader
is held in the left hand. 5. Horizontal
Bar or Horizontal Double Half Hitch
(H B or H D H H) as shown in <a href="#fig5" class="pginternal">figure #5</a>. Holding the leader taut and
parallel to the foundation yarn work
as D D H H.</p>
<div class="box">
<p>Asterisk...*. This indicates that the
directions immediately following are
to be repeated the given number of

<p>Cut two 6½ yd lengths and
twelve 4 yd lengths of <b>A</b>, eight
4 yd lengths each of <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> and
<b>D</b>. The belt will be worked in
two halves, each half measuring
12 inches, then sewn together. Take
one 6½ yd length of <b>A</b>, fold in half,
find center and tie an <b>OHK</b> 2 inches
from either side of center. Secure 4
inch center to board and anchor
lengths onto it using <b>RDHH</b> in the
following sequence: 4 <b>A</b> (including
the longer length of 4 inch section),
2 <b>B</b>, 2 <b>C</b>, 4 <b>D</b>, 2 <b>C</b>, 2 <b>B</b>, 4 <b>A</b>. Cross

leaving lengths used as leaders
untied so that the last knot is 1 inch
below foundation (first row shaping
only). Repeat with each color
working half in each direction until
<b>A</b> lengths remain in the center.
Starting on the left, * with <b>D</b> tie 8
<b>VHH</b>, with <b>C</b> tie 7, with <b>B</b> tie 3, with

work back to the right. With outside
2 <b>A</b> lengths on either side tie 8 <b>VHH</b>.
Divide the center <b>D</b> lengths into 4

8 <b>VHH</b> with first 2 lengths of <b>D</b> and
8 <b>VHH</b> with next 2 lengths of <b>D</b>.
These will be used to form the
